[Intents and intent filters](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters)

**Intents are messaging objects. When you send a message, it reaches to the android OS. The OS based on the message that is being sent, takes an appropriate action**

**What are the basic uses of Intents?**
- Start Activities
- Start Services
- Deliver a Broadcast

**Intents are two types**
- Explicit Intents
  - These intents are responsible to open an activity from an external Application (User apps).
  
- Implicit Intents
  - These intents are responsible to open an activity from an internal app (System Apps).

***How an Intent Communicates ?***
